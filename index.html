        <p id="small_talk">Wish you a great happy birthday sir, I wish you get a bright future and long life and great
            success in your teaching career I hope you and you family is good. You are the best teacher I have ever found.
            I couldn't find teacher before not now and I don't think I would find a teacher like you. I still wish to
            come back to study from you. The main thing I wanted to tell is that, do you remember you said to increase my
            friend circle? here I tried to make friends, students are frendly too, but problem is that all use so much
            of slang language and, the children which do not are not from the colony. students from colony as well as
            from outside of colony study in colony school only outsiders are the ones who can be made friend. But I can't
            find them in colony because they don't live here.</p>

        <p id="small_talk">Anyways sir if possible whenever you come raipur try to come to my home I would be glad to
            see you. Sir I specialy miss you and the trip when we went to rajasthan. Yes! 1 more thing, I couldn't attend
            any summer camp there but here was summer camp from 22 to 30 april, I chose website designing and today(30
            april) was the closing ceremony of the same and all students had to show what they learnt. According to
            my teacher mine was best but I want you to see it as well. At end of this webpage I have attached it, please
            tell me how it is on whatsapp</p>
